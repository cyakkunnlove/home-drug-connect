# HOME-DRUG CONNECT AI Integration

## Overview
HOME-DRUG CONNECT leverages AI technology to streamline communication between medical institutions and 在宅対応薬局 (home-visit pharmacies) by automatically generating professional request documents based on patient information.

## AI Document Generation Feature

### Purpose
The AI document generation feature reduces administrative burden on medical staff by automatically creating well-structured, professional request documents for pharmacies. This ensures:
- Consistent communication quality
- Complete inclusion of necessary medical information
- Time savings for healthcare providers
- Reduced errors in information transfer

### Implementation Details

#### Technology Stack
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o-mini model for document generation
- **Server-side Processing**: All AI processing happens on the server to protect API keys
- **Structured Prompts**: Carefully crafted prompts ensure medical accuracy and professionalism

#### Key Components
1. **Request Form Integration** (`/components/doctor/RequestForm.tsx`)
   - AI generation button integrated into the request form
   - Visual feedback during generation process
   - Clear indication of AI assistance to users

2. **API Endpoint** (`/app/api/ai/generate-request/route.ts`)
   - Secure server-side endpoint for AI text generation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Structured format for consistent output
   - Medical terminology awareness
   - Japanese language optimization
   - Patient privacy considerations

### Generated Document Structure
The AI generates requests with the following sections:
1. **件名** (Subject): Clear, concise request title
2. **患者基本情報** (Patient Basic Information): Demographics and identifiers
3. **現在の状況** (Current Situation): Medical condition and care needs
4. **処方内容** (Prescription Details): Medication list with dosages
5. **薬局への依頼事項** (Pharmacy Request Details): Specific requirements
6. **訪問に関する情報** (Visit Information): Schedule and logistics
7. **緊急連絡先** (Emergency Contact): Healthcare provider contact

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored securely in environment variables
- Server-side processing only (no client-side API calls)
- Patient information processed but not stored by AI
- Compliance with medical data handling standards

### User Experience
1. **One-Click Generation**: Simple button to generate document
2. **Editable Output**: Generated text can be reviewed and edited
3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and success indicators
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if generation fails

### Best Practices
- Always review AI-generated content before sending
- Ensure patient privacy in all communications
- Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement for medical judgment
- Keep prompts updated based on user feedback

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple document templates for different scenarios
- Learning from user edits to improve generation
- Integration with electronic health records
- Multi-language support for international patients
